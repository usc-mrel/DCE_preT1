# DCE_preT1
This is the pre-contrast T1 mapping script, including conventional approach (SENSE + DESPOT1) and direct estimation approach. STARDCE package (MREL) is required for DESPOT1, minFunc_2012 is required for optimization and Clinical_Recon_Pack and ESP toolbox (Justin Haldar and Tae Hyung Kim) are required for error evaluation. The script will automatically run conventional and direct T1 mapping, save results and print errors for 17 undersampling levels.
