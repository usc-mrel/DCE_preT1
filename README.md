# DCE_preT1
This is the pre-contrast T1 mapping demo, including conventional approach (SENSE + DESPOT1) and direct estimation approach. The demo will automatically run conventional and direct T1 mapping, save results and print errors for 17 undersampling levels.
- **STARDCE package** (MREL, https://github.com/usc-mrel/STARDCE) is required for DESPOT1.
- **ESP** toolbox (Justin Haldar and Tae Hyung Kim, https://mr.usc.edu/download/ESP/) are required for error evaluation.
